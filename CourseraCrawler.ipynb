These courses provide a wealth of knowledge about different aspects of business management, allowing learners to kickstart their entrepreneurial journey.‎Chevron RightWhat are the best  business courses for beginners?‎For those just starting out in the business world, a few of the best beginners courses are Macroeconomics for Business Management course to learn the basics of economics and financial decision making. UVA Darden's Foundations of Business Strategy to gain a better understanding of the business landscape and to learn techniques for effective strategy. The Fundamentals of International Business to better understand how businesses operate in other countries. And Business and Management Basics to learn more about the tools and skills needed to compete in the global business world.‎Chevron RightWhat are the best advanced  business courses?‎The Coursera offers some of the best advanced business courses available online. These courses provide professionals with in-depth knowledge of Excel, Advanced Financial Reporting, Design Strategy, Business Forecasting and Time Series,  and Financing for Start-ups. For example, Excel Advanced provides learners with a comprehensive view of excel software applications.

Design Strategy teaches skills for strategic design, such as problem-solving, customer research, and prototyping. Business Forecasting and Time Series explores forecasting and time series analysis. And Financing Start-ups provides insights into fundraising strategies, financial planning and budgeting.‎Chevron RightWhat does it mean to study business?‎\"Business\" seems like it should be a familiar subject — you use businesses every day of your life! But an education in this field teaches you the specific skills that go into building a successful business. A business, broadly speaking, refers to people working together in an organization to sell goods or services. In practice, this business enterprise can take an incredibly wide variety of forms: a for-profit corporation, a non-profit agency, a charity, an entrepreneurial startup, a sole proprietor consultancy, and many more. Regardless of what your vision is, a business education will equip you with the capabilities you need to make it a reality.\n",
            "‎Chevron RightWhat are examples of popular careers in business?‎There are many different kinds of businesses, but every business needs team members with certain specific skills and responsibilities to succeed. Regardless of whether a company is a for-profit or a non-profit, managing cashflow is essential, making accountants, financial managers, and financial advisors indispensable. Keeping any organization running smoothly requires operations managers, executive assistants, and other administrative professionals. Large corporations may employ a wide range of in-house professionals to cover legal, marketing, sales, and other areas full-time, but smaller businesses as well as \"lean\" organizations may meet these needs by hiring outside consultants.\n",
            "‎Chevron RightHow can taking business courses online help my career?‎If you’re looking to advance your career in business, there are plenty of online courses and short Guided Projects available that can help you build these skills right away. Courses in finance, accounting, and business modeling can give you the tools you need to manage your cashflow wisely. Business planning, value chain management, and project management can help you optimize your operations for success. If you’re a people person, you might want to take online courses in negotiation, communication, and strategic leadership. And if you’re a numbers person, courses in business analytics, statistics, and digital transformation can help you put data to work. Whatever your business background, online courses can take you further!‎Chevron RightCan I pursue a masters degree in business online?‎Yes! Online education isn’t just about individual courses anymore. Online learning platforms like Coursera offer a range of masters programs that you can complete on your own time, including business degrees geared towards your specific goals. For example, Coursera offers Master of Science in Accountancy from the highly-rated University of Illinois accounting program, Masters of Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Illinois and Macquarie University, and, for aspiring startup founders, a Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship from HEC Paris.‎Chevron RightWhat skills or experience do I need to have, before starting to learn business?‎Some of the skills and experience that you would be wise to gain before starting to learn business include knowledge of companies and markets, of products and prices, and of supply and demand. These are key business concepts that come up in most discussions of how a product or service gets sold to a particular audience. Having smart communications skills, strategic thinking, and a good grasp of data and research are also skills that would benefit you in learning business.‎Chevron RightHow do I know if learning business is right for me?‎You may know if learning business is right for you if you're already an entrepreneurial person, selling goods or services on your own. Having the experience of marketing one’s own product or service can go a long way to knowing if being in business is right for you. Also, if you have a passion for products, pricing, marketing, customer service, and the processes that surround selling products online, then this could be a good career fit for you.‎Chevron RightWhat types of places hire people with a background in business?‎If you have a business background, you might be able to find work in insurance companies, banks, consumer products companies, management consultancies, and other places. Finding good workers skilled in business processes, from understanding financial documents to strategic thinking about product roll-outs, is a key part of the human resources function in companies. If you can work with a company that is in an industry that excites you, you may be able to grow your career successfully.‎Chevron RightWhat are common career paths for someone in business?‎Common career paths for someone in business may start with junior roles in accounting, management, or marketing.

            "Frequently Asked Questions about HealthChevron RightWhat is health education and why is it important?‎Health literacy isn’t just for doctors going to medical school, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health is an extraordinarily complex topic, including not only the treatment of illness for individuals but also the links between individual wellness and society. As the current crisis is demonstrating so urgently, understanding those connections and the way that illness is spread are critical to protecting public health. Other links between individual health and society includes the availability of health services, safety of the built environment, emissions of pollution and toxins, and other factors. Protecting the health of people and the communities in which they live is thus the work of professionals across a variety of fields, including medicine, public policy, engineering and design, social science, safety research, and more. For instance, public health historians are playing an important role today in helping to highlight important differences between COVID-19 and more limited recent outbreaks like H1N1, as well as parallels to past global epidemics such as the Spanish Flu of 1918.For this and other reasons, health is a major growth industry, with a wide range of job opportunities. Major factors driving growth in health jobs include the health crises, like epidemics and pandemics, as well as long term factors such as rising life expectancy and incomes in countries around the world. This increases demand and expectations for quality healthcare. And as we gain more and more data on the connections between individual choices, external risks, and health outcomes, new opportunities are emerging at the intersection of healthcare and technology - or “healthtech” - to come up with innovative new approaches to stopping the spread of disease and improving wellness.\n",

            "Frequently Asked Questions about Social SciencesChevron RightWhat are the social sciences, and why is it important to study them?‎The social sciences encompass a number of related academic disciplines as diverse as economics, sociology, political science, and anthropology. Through all these different lenses, the social sciences help to explain how society works, providing valuable insights for businesses, politicians, journalists, and anyone else who wants to understand the world.These insights can be just as important and valuable as any produced by “hard” sciences such as biology, chemistry, or physics, but the objects of study as well as the analytic methods used are different in the social sciences. Unlike the highly quantitative approach typical of laboratory work, social scientists typically rely on a mix of both quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis in studying different aspects of our complex society.For instance, if you're trying to understand the homelessness crisis, data on trends in homelessness in different cities may provide an important foundation for analysis, but an urban anthropologist would also use field work and case studies to see how these factors interact in the real world. Similarly, an economist might look at GDP, the stock market, and unemployment data to help predict trends in economic growth, but will also factor in more qualitative analyses of elements such as trade politics, technology development, and more. While every branch of social science uses a different mix of analytic tools, they are all united by a common interest in interpreting the world of human beings.‎Chevron RightWhat kind of careers can you get with a background in the social sciences?‎Having a background in the social sciences means you have tools to analyze our shared world and explain why things happen the way they do -- and potentially predict future trends. This skill set is a powerful foundation for many types of jobs, but the career paths available to you in social science can vary widely depending on your field of study. Some of the highest-paying jobs in the social sciences are for majors in economics, who often study the way money moves through society to produce goods and create wealth. Economics majors can put their skills to work as financial analysts, responsible for sophisticated financial modeling and industry analysis work used to guide investment decisions for banks, mutual funds, and other financial institutions. Political science majors may also find high-paying careers as well. Because they are experts on the interactions between politics, policy, and society, they may also find work at investment firms, where the analysis of political risk can be of critical importance. They may also become paralegals or lawyers, using their knowledge of the political processes that create laws to assist in their interpretation. And political science majors may go into a career in government themselves, which can be a rewarding path for many even if pay is typically less than in the private sector.Indeed, many economics and political science majors, as well as students of other fields like anthropology and sociology, go into the social sciences with career goals that aren't only related to salary. The social sciences are fundamentally about people, and they tend to draw many learners who want to make our world a better place.For example, someone with a major in anthropology might become a social worker or probation officer, using their insights into human nature and culture to help make positive changes in the lives of individuals. A sociologist might work with a non-profit housing organization, analyzing eviction data to advocate for tenants' rights. In cases like these, the social sciences can provide a foundation for a career filled with purpose.‎Chevron RightWhat kinds of online courses can you take in the social sciences on Coursera?‎The field of social science encompasses a diverse range of topics, but Coursera's vast and growing catalog of high-quality courses, Specializations, Guided Projects and degrees can meet your needs no matter what your specific area of interest is.For example, if you want to study anthropology, you can take courses in child development, cognitive science, or even happiness. Analytically-oriented sociology students might wish to take courses in basic statistics or criminal justice. If your focus is political science, you can learn about government, public policy, human rights, or international law. And if you want a career in economics, you can find courses in macro and microeconomics, financial markets, and business law.As the world's leading online learning platform, Coursera gives you the opportunity to learn about the social sciences from top-ranked schools like Yale University, the University of California, Irvine, and the University of Amsterdam. You can get the same high-quality education as on-campus students with the flexibility and lower cost offered by online learning.‎Chevron RightWhat kind of people are best suited for roles in social sciences?‎People who are good at strategic thinking with an interest in sharing their insight with others are best suited to study social sciences. The key to studying social sciences is finding a topic you are passionate about and learning as much as you can about it. People who study social sciences need to be able to read, understand, and interpret data and explain why it matters and how it will impact the world. In addition to analyzing data, it’s important to know how to find quality information backed by science that you can communicate to a team or business.‎Chevron RightWhat skills or experience do I need to already have, before starting to learn social sciences?‎A beginner's level knowledge of a topic is all you need to begin studying social sciences. Social sciences is the study of behaviors, so it’s important to have an interest in how humans interact, communicate, and behave in social settings. Organizational skills and an ability to interpret data will help you sort through the information and present your findings in a clear, concise manner.‎Chevron RightWhat are common career paths for someone in social sciences?‎People with an interest in social sciences centered on public health can explore careers related to COVID-19 contact tracing and managing COVID-19 in senior housing facilities including nursing homes and independent living communities. For those interested in social sciences related to human rights, career paths may include working with organizations who help refugees, migrants, and asylum seekers. Another career path for those studying social sciences is conducting anti-racism workshops and seminars in workplaces. This may include defining systemic and institutional racism and how to talk about race and racism.‎Chevron RightWhat topics can I study that are related to social sciences?‎If you are curious about how financial markets work, you may want to explore topics in social sciences with a focus on economics or model thinking. People with an interest in social justice, inequality, and race may benefit from social science courses centered around community organizing and inclusion in the workplace. Topics that examine game theory are useful for people studying political science or competition amongst firms. Social science topics related to American law can give learners a glimpse of the law in different settings, including criminal law, constitutional law, and civil procedure.‎Chevron RightWhat are the benefits of taking an online Social Sciences course?‎Online Social Sciences courses offer a convenient and flexible way to enhance your existing knowledge or learn new Social Sciences skills. With a wide range of Social Sciences classes, you can conveniently learn at your own pace to advance your Social Sciences career.‎Chevron RightWhat Social Sciences courses are best for training and upskilling employees or the workforce?‎When looking to enhance your workforce's skills in Social Sciences, it's crucial to select a course that aligns with their current abilities and learning objectives. Our Skills Dashboard is an invaluable tool for identifying skill gaps and choosing the most appropriate course for effective upskilling. For a comprehensive understanding of how our courses can benefit your employees, explore the enterprise solutions we offer.

            "Frequently Asked Questions about Personal DevelopmentChevron RightWhat is personal development and why is it important?‎Personal development is the process of reflecting on your skills and qualities, considering how they relate to your goals in life, and identifying ways to build the strengths you need to succeed. Engaging in the lifelong process of personal growth can pay dividends in your inner life, your family life, your relationships, and in your professional development.Think about childhood development as an analogy. As an infant grows from a toddler to a preschooler into childhood and then adolescence, they acquire crucial skills like walking, talking, fine motor skills, reading, and countless others. While we may be finished with the dramatic physical growth of childhood, we must continue to learn the more sophisticated skills we need for success in the adult world: patience and discipline, financial and career planning, listening at the office and at home, finding a sense of inner calm in the midst of a hectic day, and so much more.The path you take in your personal development is different for everyone. Approaches to achieving personal growth are as different as the individual qualities and goals guiding them. But, as the explosion of interest in this field in recent years attests, personal development is something we can all learn about no matter what stage of life we are in.‎Chevron RightWhat role does personal development play in career success?‎While many learners focus their career development efforts on building 'hard skills' in areas like computer science, medicine, accountancy, or finance, almost all careers also rely on the 'soft skills' that are closely intertwined with your personal development. These hard and soft skills are often more closely related than you might think. For example, good communication skills are essential to management positions in any industry, and the inner confidence that comes from mindfulness practices can be a major asset in marketing roles or business negotiations.many people who become skilled in their own personal development may harness this in their career more directly and become a professional in this field. Careers in personal development can cover a wide spectrum of roles, from occupational therapists to life coaches to personal finance teachers to career planning counselors. Depending on your path in personal development and your own soft skills, you may find that the most rewarding career path is in enabling the personal and professional growth of others.‎Chevron RightHow can online courses help with personal development?‎With the ability to make personal connections virtually, online courses have become a terrific way to learn the interpersonal “soft skills” and lessons in personal growth needed to meet your personal development needs. The flexibility of online learning is particularly well-suited to building personal development skills, since you can select individual courses you need instead of pursuing a full degree program. The ability to complete coursework on your schedule is also a huge advantage, - especially if you're working full time or raising a family.Coursera hosts a number of popular courses and Specializations in personal development, taught by instructors at top universities. For example, you can take classes to help with creative writing, leadership, job interview skills, and more from universities like University of Illinois, and Yale. For a more in-depth education, Specializations in Dynamic Public Speaking from the University of Washington, Career Success from the University of California, Irvine, and Interview Skills and Resume Writing from the University of Maryland, College Park offer opportunities to pursue your personal development goals across a sequence of courses. Coursera offers some of these career development courses for free.‎Chevron RightWhat skills or experience do I need to already have, before starting to learn personal development?‎You do not need to have any special skills or experience to begin working on personal development. No matter where you are in your personal or professional life, there are benefits to learning the skills that will enhance your personal development. There is no finish line for personal development. It’s an ongoing process that may take you down many different roads over time. One of the keys to successfully beginning a personal development journey is having an open mind and heart. You may be asked to try things you’ve never done before, and it’s important for you to be willing to step out of your comfort zone.‎Chevron RightHow do I know if learning personal development is right for me?‎If you're looking for more fulfillment or happiness in your life, personal development may be a way to help you achieve those goals. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to personal development. Everyone’s path will look different, but the goals are the same. It’s about expressing gratitude, savoring the moment, and learning how to maximize your potential so you can become the best version of yourself. Personal development courses will give you the skills you need to recognize that social, emotional, mental, and physical health are all pieces of a puzzle that come together to help shape your body and mind into the best version it can be.‎Chevron RightWhat topics can I study that are related to personal development?‎Studying meditation can help you learn about mindfulness, gratitude, and savoring the moment. Leaning about time and task management will help you become more productive and fulfilled in your personal and professional life. The science of exercise and eating will give you the tools you need to have a healthy body that can fight off fatigue and stress. If you want to learn how to be more resilient and develop skills to decrease anxiety, you can study topics that address positive psychology and well-being.‎Chevron RightWhat types of places hire people with a background in personal development?‎Businesses and corporations hire people with a background in personal development to help inspire, motivate, and encourage employees. Their job may be to help teams alter their behaviors so they can set high expectations and still reach their goals. People with a background in personal development may also become coaches who train managers in how to lead their teams and manage workplace expectations. These coaches teach managers problem-solving techniques and time management strategies.‎Chevron RightWhat are the benefits of taking an online Personal Development course?‎Online Personal Development courses offer a convenient and flexible way to enhance your existing knowledge or learn new Personal Development skills. With a wide range of Personal Development classes, you can conveniently learn at your own pace to advance your Personal Development career.‎Chevron RightWhat Personal Development courses are best for training and upskilling employees or the workforce?‎When looking to enhance your workforce's skills in Personal Development, it's crucial to select a course that aligns with their current abilities and learning objectives.

            "Frequently Asked Questions about Arts and HumanitiesChevron RightWhat are the arts and humanities, and why are they important?‎Anyone that's ever watched a film, seen a concert, or gone to a museum has engaged with the arts. But what are “the humanities?” This broader category is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as “literature, language, history, philosophy, and other subjects that are not a science.” Despite the fact that these two topics span everything from the new Ariana Grande album to Plato's Republic, they are often grouped together as one realm of academic study. That's because all of these works of culture are fundamental expressions of human society. And, by studying the historical context of creative works, as well as their formal characteristics, experts in the arts and humanities can draw out important lessons about who we are, how we think, and why our world is the way that it is.‎Chevron RightWhat career opportunities are there in the arts and humanities?‎You don't have to be a movie star or a famous novelist to work in the arts and humanities. If you have a passion for culture, there are countless opportunities to find a career path in whatever area of this diverse field that you feel called to. In the arts, you might be surprised to learn how many 'behind the scenes' roles are responsible for your favorite music and movies. For example, a studio album isn't just the result of the band turning on their amps, hitting record, and rocking out. It takes a whole team of sound engineers, producers, and mastering engineers to create the finished record, as well as public relations (or “PR”) professionals, booking agents, and tour managers to promote it once it is released.Similarly, you don't need to be a model to get involved in the fashion industry. If you have a passion for style, you can train to become a fashion designer and put your visions into the world. Or, you could become a fashion photographer, prop stylist, or publicist and help these visions reach the audience they deserve.Career paths are just as numerous in the humanities. If you love history or philosophy, you can become an expert author in these fields, or even pursue a PhD. However, you can also find satisfying careers working in important roles in the publishing industry, such as the editors, literary agents, and publicists who are responsible for connecting talents in these fields with the very specific audiences they need to reach.‎Chevron RightHow can online courses help me develop my skills in the arts and humanities?‎While online learning is often associated with courses for programming or other computer science subjects, it is also a great opportunity to pursue an education in the arts and humanities. You can take classes from wherever you are in the world, and often for a much lower cost than on-campus students. The scheduling flexibility offered by online education options can be particularly important for writers or artists who want to build their professional skill-set while continuing to hone their craft.As the world's leading online learning platform, Coursera offers a wide range of arts and humanities courses and Specializations from renowned institutions like the California Institute of the Arts, Wesleyan University, the University of Edinburgh, and even the Museum of Modern Art. Whether you're looking to develop technical skills in areas like photography and fashion design, or enhance your ability to see the big picture in the fields of religion, mindfulness, and literature, online courses can be a great fit for your career goals in the arts and humanities.‎Chevron RightHow do I know if learning about arts and humanities is right for me?‎Learning about the arts and humanities may be right for you if you have a passion for exploring human culture along with the works of art, literature, laws, and languages that connect and define groups of people. Perhaps you enjoy creative hobbies like performing, playing instruments, or drawing. You may want to discover the stories behind your favorite works of art or music and develop a greater appreciation for them. You also may be drawn to world religions, literature, or languages and want to learn more about how they have shaped civilization and evolved over time.‎Chevron RightWhat are common career paths for someone in arts and humanities?‎Common career paths for someone in arts and humanities include visual arts, education, music, theater, and writing. Someone with a background in the arts and humanities may work in the arts as a teacher or performer. Others may use a foundation in arts and humanities to work in the legal profession, government agencies, or non-profit organizations where they may take roles as lawyers, researchers, team leaders, and community outreach members.‎Chevron RightWhat topics can I study that are related to arts and humanities?‎Other topics you can study that are related to arts and humanities include social sciences like history, sociology, and anthropology. Social sciences and humanities examine similar themes—politics, law, language, economics—through different lenses, namely science or critical analysis. You may also consider taking lessons in specific types of arts, such as painting, drawing, or playing an instrument. Alternatively, you may consider learning more about topics like grant writing, research methods, and communications.‎Chevron RightWhat types of places hire people with a background in arts and humanities?‎Places that hire people with a background in arts and humanities include corporations, government agencies, schools, and non-profit organizations. Many of the skills you develop and practice using in your studies of arts and humanities transfer to daily work in an organization. They include problem-solving, communication, and critical analysis. Organizations that value employees with strong research skills and the ability to interpret information and influence others may also hire people with a background in arts and humanities.‎Chevron RightWhat are the benefits of taking an online Arts and Humanities course?‎Online Arts and Humanities courses offer a convenient and flexible way to enhance your knowledge or learn new Arts and Humanities skills. Choose from a wide range of Arts and Humanities courses offered by top universities and industry leaders tailored to various skill levels.‎Chevron RightWhat Arts and Humanities courses are best for training and upskilling employees or the workforce?‎When looking to enhance your workforce's skills in Arts and Humanities, it's crucial to select a course that aligns with their current abilities and learning objectives.

            "Frequently Asked Questions about Physical Science and EngineeringChevron RightWhat is physical science and why is it important to study?‎Physical science explains all that we know about the workings of the natural world, from the deepest core of Earth to the farthest reaches of space - and from microscopic atoms to the entire atmospheric system of the planet. This truly vast topic encompasses a diverse range of more specific subfields including chemistry, geology, astronomy, physics, oceanography, and more. Each of these disciplines within the physical sciences has a different approach to studying the individual elements and processes that characterize their particular area of focus. Many people go into the physical sciences out of a simple love for the material. Knowing the way the geology of the planet has evolved over billions of years, or understanding the magical-seeming processes that drive chemical reactions, can be fascinating and inherently satisfying. However, the physical sciences are also vital to understanding and solving critically important challenges faced by society. For example, geology is essential to natural resource exploration, guiding the effort of mining companies to find raw materials like coal and copper.  Atmospheric science is foundational to our understanding of climate change, explaining how carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are responsible for rising temperatures - and estimating how much (and how soon) we need to cut these emissions to preserve a habitable planet. And both physics and astronomy are necessary for space exploration, potentially charting new paths forward for the future of humanity. Each of these fields may be quite different and distinct from each other, but together they seek to describe all of the interrelated aspects of our physical world. And, while we’ve come a long way in this knowledge, there is still much that we don’t yet understand - and thus many exciting, world-changing new discoveries to be made by experts in all of the physical sciences.‎Chevron RightWhat kinds of careers can you pursue in the physical sciences?‎The career paths available to those with an education in the physical sciences are just as varied as the different areas of study within this vast field. Some areas with largely scientific applications tend to lead towards jobs in academia or education. For instance, astronomy majors with bachelor’s degrees often become high school teachers or work at planetariums, while many others continue to graduate school to pursue a career in research answering questions about the extraterrestrial universe. By contrast, physics is an example of a field that can lead to a wide range of jobs both inside and outside of academia. If you want to do laboratory research at cutting-edge facilities like CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), you can aspire to become a particle physicist and study the behavior of the subatomic world. On the other hand, if you want to solve more practical problems on a (much) larger scale, physics is also highly useful for careers designing buildings and other structures as an engineer.Geoscience backgrounds can also lead to a variety of non-academic careers, depending on which area of this field you are interested in. Geologists are employed by mining and drilling companies to help determine where to find valuable resources under the earth’s surface, and experience in this area can also lead to work providing insights to various companies in finance and as an energy consultant. Specialists in hydrology can find work studying the composition of bodies of water for environmental agencies or advocacy groups.‎Chevron RightWhat online courses does Coursera offer in physical science?‎Online courses are a great way to learn about topics in physical science and engineering, giving you the opportunity to start a new direction in your education as a beginner or add to your existing knowledge as a more advanced learner.

            "Frequently Asked Questions about Language LearningChevron RightWhy is it important to study languages?‎The ability to communicate through language is one of the most important things that defines us as humans. But for some people, language learning essentially stops after they learn to speak their own native tongue at a young age - or, for others, once they finish their required foreign language courses in high school or college. This is especially common in America, where learning languages other than English can seem like an unnecessary luxury or an academic exercise.This attitude risks severely limiting the horizons of your world, and missing out on one of the most rewarding experiences of life: making connections with people that are different from you. The ability to speak foreign languages opens up opportunities to connect with millions, even hundreds of millions, of people from other countries - as well as people from other cultures in your own country. For example, according to U.S. Census data, over 20% of American households speak a language other than English at home - including over 13% that speak Spanish at home.Foreign language skills can also make travel abroad infinitely more rewarding. If you’ve spent time in a country where you don’t speak the language, you know how painful and embarrassing it is to be able to communicate only through facial expressions, body language, and a handful of poorly-pronounced phrases for ordering food at restaurants. Being able to speak the right language, even at a medium level of ability, opens up the possibility of making friends, understanding cultural nuances, and exploring new places “like a local.” Whether you want to expand your personal map of the world, open doors to new career paths, or just experience the joy of cross-cultural connection, the ability to learn new languages is an indispensable ability. And, thanks to online courses and other tools, opportunities for language learning are more accessible than ever.‎Chevron RightWhat kind of career paths are possible with language skills?‎“Soft skills” of all kinds, including strong interpersonal communications ability, are in high demand for employers of all kinds. The ability to speak foreign languages is a particularly powerful case; the ability to speak multiple languages is indicative of a higher level of communications skills in general, and for more and more businesses this capability can be a major asset. For example, in America, many jobs in areas as diverse as customer support and restaurant management may either require or preferentially hire applicants that speak Spanish. Language skills are also foundational, and absolutely required, for a number of other career paths.  A translator must be able to carefully convert the meaning and nuance of texts across two languages, whether they’re translating literature, advertising copy, or film subtitles. Interpreters, meanwhile, need to be able to bridge two languages in real-time, requiring a high level of ability in both languages as well as the ability to think on your feet. If you have excellent language skills and want an even higher-profile career, you can work in the foreign service as an intelligence agent, or in other government linguist jobs in the military or diplomatic agencies. The work of these language specialists can be very high-pressure, with potential for international ramifications - or even life or death risks - if material is translated or interpreted incorrectly. However, the impact and prestige of these jobs may be unmatched in the field of language, and they certainly provide a rewarding career path for language experts that want to serve their country.‎Chevron RightWhat online courses does Coursera offer for building language skills?‎Online courses are a great opportunity for language learning, thanks to the ability to review and practice material at your own pace. You can take courses to improve your speaking ability, your writing skills, or even details of grammar in a foreign language. The ability to complete coursework on a flexible schedule also makes online courses a great fit for learning foreign languages while continuing to work full-time or raising a family.In addition to acquiring language skills yourself, online courses can be a great way to learn how to help others learn languages - for example, through ESL (English as a second language) teaching courses. There are also opportunities to dive more deeply into the discipline, with online courses in specialized areas like linguistics, computational linguistics, or even archaeology. Regardless of your area of language learning interest, online courses offered through Coursera let you build your skills at a lower cost than on-campus students without sacrificing in quality. You can take courses from top-ranked institutions from around the world, such as Peking University in China, École Polytechnique in France, Universiteit Leiden in Germany, and Arizona State University and the University of California in America. ‎Chevron RightWhat skills or experience do I need to already have, before starting language learning?‎There is no specific experience required before starting language learning. Learners should have an interest in the language at hand and a willingness to commit to the time needed to learn the new language. People who work in the environment where the language being studied is spoken may have an easier time picking up the language than others. Excellent listening skills are a must, as well as organizational and reading comprehension skills.‎Chevron RightHow do I know if language learning is right for me?‎People who desire to speak a second language are best suited for language learning. Language learning is about broadening your horizons and finding ways to communicate with people you may not have been able to engage with before. If you travel to other countries, language learning can help you navigate not only a workspace but restaurants, hotels, and other daily arrangements. People who want to improve communication skills, send clearer emails, and feel confident speaking to colleagues are great candidates for language learning.‎Chevron RightWhat are common career paths for someone in language learning?‎The most common career path for someone in language learning is teaching English as a second language. This rewarding career path is a great way to effectively teach learners how to confidently read, write, and converse in a second language. The next gradual step for more advanced speakers is a career as a translator working in a business, hospital, courtroom, or school.‎Chevron RightWhat topics can I study that are related to language learning?‎Cross-cultural communication skills can teach you not only vocabulary and grammar rules but also how to effectively use tone and style in both written and spoken communication. Finance and economic language courses may teach you to effectively craft an email, give a presentation, and write reports using vocabulary and language skills commonly used in financial settings. Media literacy courses may help you navigate both traditional and social media with a focus on advertising and the meaning of bias. If you want to delve even deeper into media literacy, topics that explain journalism may help language learners understand how and why news stories are written by digging into the principles behind the research and writing of the news today.‎Chevron RightWhat are the benefits of taking an online Language Learning course?‎Online Language Learning courses offer a convenient and flexible way to enhance your existing knowledge or learn new Language Learning skills. With a wide range of Language Learning classes, you can conveniently learn at your own pace to advance your Language Learning career.‎Chevron RightWhat Language Learning courses are best for training and upskilling employees or the workforce?‎When looking to enhance your workforce's skills in Language Learning, it's crucial to select a course that aligns with their current abilities and learning objectives.

            "Frequently Asked Questions about Math and LogicChevron RightWhat is the study of math and logic, and why is it important?‎The study of mathematics and logic as a discipline adds up to a lot more than what you learned in high school algebra. According to the Oxford Dictionary, math is \"the abstract science of number, quantity, and space.\" This system of logic and quantitative reasoning may be abstract in its nature, but its use is fundamental to solving some very concrete problems - it literally structures our world.The study of math and logic combines the abstract science of numbers with quantitative reasoning that is fundamental in solving concrete problems.For instance, engineers rely on geometry, calculus, physics, and other mathematical tools to ensure buildings are constructed safely. Computer programmers who create the mapping apps we use to navigate our cities apply problem-solving logic,  algorithms, data, and probability to recommend the best route to take at a given time of day. And even \"soft science\" disciplines like sociology rely on sophisticated statistical regression techniques to draw out insights about the workings of our human world. Thus, math and logic is important to us all in our daily lives, whether we use it directly in our own work or simply live in the modern world that it makes possible.\n",
            "‎Chevron RightWhat careers can I pursue in the area of mathematics?‎If you have great math skills and a deep passion for mathematics in its purest, most abstract form, the answer to this question is obvious: you can become a mathematician. Given the critical importance of math to so many fields, this is an exceptionally in-demand role, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that mathematician jobs will grow by 30% between 2018 and 2028 - one of the fastest rates of any field! However, you don't have to become a mathematician to use math and logic skills in your career. Virtually all jobs in computer science rely heavily on these skills, since programming is fundamentally about the creation of systems of logic and application of algorithms. So whether you want to go into software development, data science, or artificial intelligence, you'll need a strong background in logic and discrete math as well as statistics.Math skills are becoming increasingly important for other jobs in both the hard and soft sciences as well. This is due in part to growing opportunities to leverage computer science approaches, particularly data science, to answer pressing questions with findings from larger datasets than ever before. For example, skills in statistical analysis are increasingly central to the work of natural scientists looking for patterns in the growth of certain species populations -- or for epidemiologists studying the spread of public health threats.‎Chevron RightHow can online courses help with my math skills?‎Online courses are a popular way to learn about many different topics in computer science, and this format also lends itself well to building your math and logic skills.
